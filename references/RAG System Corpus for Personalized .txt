10. Nutrition and Hydration for Swimmers
Pre-Swim Nutrition

Carbohydrates: Consume easy-to-digest carbohydrates such as fruits (bananas, apples), whole grains (oats, whole wheat bread), and low-fiber vegetables (potatoes, squash).
Protein: Include a small amount of protein to maintain energy levels. Suitable options include yogurt, a small handful of nuts, or a boiled egg.
Timing: It is recommended to eat 1-2 hours before swimming to ensure adequate digestion and to avoid gastrointestinal discomfort. A small snack can be consumed 30 minutes before if needed.
Example Pre-Swim Meal: A bowl of oatmeal with sliced bananas and a drizzle of honey, or a turkey sandwich on whole wheat bread with lettuce and tomato.
Hydration Strategies
Importance of Hydration: Staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining performance and preventing dehydration, which can negatively impact both physical and cognitive functions.
Water Intake: Drink water regularly throughout the day, aiming for at least 8-10 cups of water daily. Increase this amount on training days.
Electrolyte Balance: For sessions longer than 60 minutes or in hot conditions, include electrolyte-rich drinks such as sports drinks or coconut water to replenish lost electrolytes.
Hydration Check: Monitor hydration status by checking the color of urine; it should be light yellow. Darker urine indicates a need for more fluids.
Post-Swim Recovery Nutrition
Recovery Foods and Drinks: Post-swim nutrition is essential for muscle recovery, replenishing energy stores, and overall recovery.
Protein and Carbohydrates: Aim to consume a balanced meal or snack that includes both protein and carbohydrates within 30-60 minutes post-swim. This helps in muscle repair and replenishing glycogen stores.
Examples:
A protein smoothie made with milk, a banana, spinach, and protein powder.
A turkey wrap with hummus, lettuce, and tomato on a whole grain tortilla.
Greek yogurt topped with berries and a drizzle of honey.
Hydration Post-Swim: Continue to hydrate after swimming. Drinking water or a recovery drink that includes electrolytes can help restore fluid balance and prevent dehydration.
Nutrient Timing
Pre-Training: Consume a small meal or snack with carbohydrates and a bit of protein 1-2 hours before training.
During Training: For sessions longer than 90 minutes, consider consuming a sports drink or energy gel to maintain energy levels.
Post-Training: Focus on a balanced meal or snack that includes protein and carbohydrates within 30-60 minutes after training for optimal recovery.
Daily Nutrition for Swimmers
Balanced Diet: Ensure a balanced diet with a mix of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to support overall health and performance.
Carbohydrates: 50-60% of total daily calories should come from carbohydrates, including whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.
Proteins: 15-20% of total daily calories should come from proteins, such as lean meats, dairy products, legumes, and nuts.
Fats: 20-30% of total daily calories should come from healthy fats, such as avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil.
Vitamins and Minerals: Ensure adequate intake of vitamins and minerals through a varied diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole foods. Important nutrients for swimmers include iron, calcium, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids.
Meal Planning: Plan meals and snacks to align with training schedules, ensuring adequate energy availability for training sessions and recovery.
This detailed and structured approach ensures swimmers have the necessary information to maintain optimal nutrition and hydration for performance and recovery. Adjustments can be made based on individual needs and specific training demands.
